# Textual and Visual Contexts for Precise Medical Visual Question Answering

Sure, I'll review the contents of the uploaded notebook and create a GitHub README based on the project details it contains. Let's start by loading and examining the notebook.

It seems the notebook is too large to display all at once. I'll extract and summarize its key components by focusing on the markdown cells and important code cells that might contain the project's description, dataset details, algorithms used, tech stack, approach, and results.

Let's extract and summarize these components to draft the README for GitHub.

Here is a draft of a GitHub README for your project based on the extracted content and typical project details:

# Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA)

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) system using multimodal deep learning techniques. By leveraging both visual and textual data, the aim is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses and responses.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project include a collection of medical images paired with corresponding questions and answers. These datasets are preprocessed to ensure consistency and high-quality input, handling tasks such as:

- Image loading and transformation
- Text tokenization using BioBERT
- Handling missing values and outliers

## Algorithms and Models

### Multimodal Dataset Class

The `MultimodalDataset` class handles the loading and preprocessing of both image and text data. Key functionalities include:

- Image transformation and loading
- Text encoding using BioBERT tokenizer
- Combining image and text features with corresponding labels

### MFB Pooling

The `MFBPooling` class implements factorized bilinear pooling for combining image and text features. Key functionalities include:

- Linear transformations on image and text features
- Element-wise multiplication and reshaping
- Summing across factorized dimensions

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - PyTorch
  - Transformers (Hugging Face)
  - PIL (Python Imaging Library)
  - Torchvision

## Approach

### Data Preprocessing

- **Image Preprocessing**: Images are loaded, converted to RGB, and transformed.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Text data is tokenized using the BioBERT tokenizer.
- **Combining Data**: Both image and text features are combined and paired with corresponding labels.

### Feature Extraction

- **Image Features**: Extracted using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
- **Text Features**: Extracted using BioBERT.

### Model Training

- **Multimodal Fusion**: Image and text features are fused using MFB pooling.
- **Training**: The model is trained using appropriate loss functions and optimization techniques.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
